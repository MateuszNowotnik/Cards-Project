Card game called Goad which is played between a dealer and a player. The player can either start a new game or continue the previous game by loading the player’s profile. A new game will assign 100 credits to the player initially, otherwise, the credits will be loaded from the profile. 


Rules:

- The dealer deals 2 cards to the player, and the player places a bet for the round. If the two cards’ numbers are in sequence, another two cards will be dealt until the two cards’ numbers differ by at least 1.
- The player is allowed to pass a round without placing any bet. Here, Ace is the smallest and King is the biggest.
- If the player places a bet, the player draws a card. If the drawn card is between the 2 dealt cards in number, the player wins and obtains a double of their bet. The player loses their bet to the dealer if the drawn card is outside the 2 dealt cards in number.
- If the player chooses to pass a round twice on a roll, they must play the third round with at least half of the credits the player has regardless what cards the dealer has dealt.
